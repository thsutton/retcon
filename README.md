Retcon
======

[![Build status][badge]][status]

*Retcon* is a small system to [retcon][] structured documents between two or
more data sources. The goal is to de-couple systems which operate on the same
data: each can maintain it's own copy of the data and rely on *retcon* to
propagate any changes.

While *retcon* can propagate non-conflicting changes automatically, most
conflicting changes will need to be resolve by a human being.

*Retcon* also exposes a small HTTP API allowing other systems to post update
notifications, and tools and humans to resolve conflicts, etc.

Binaries
--------

This package produces three executables:

* `retcond`: long-running server that receives notifications and issues updates
to entity sources as required.

* `retcon-client`: send a notification to a `retcond` server.

* `retcon-oneshot`: useful for testing and debugging, perform a retcon update
without going through the rigmarole of setting up a `retcond` and then issuing
a requests with retcon-client.

Building
--------

You will require [libpq][] installed.
